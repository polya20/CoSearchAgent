# CoSearchAgent: A Lightweight Collaborative Search Agent with Large Language Models

To better support the research in collaborative search, in this demo, we propose 
CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborative search agent powered
by LLMs. CoSearchAgent is designed as a Slack plugin that can
support collaborative search during multi-party conversations on
this platform. Equipped with the capacity to understand the queries
and contexts in multi-user conversations and the ability to search
the Web for relevant information via APIs, CoSearchAgent can respond to user queries with answers grounded on the relevant search
results. It can also ask clarifying questions when the information
needs are unclear.
