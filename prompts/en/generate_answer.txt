[1] The cause of Alzheimer's disease remains unknown. Alzheimer's disease is currently regarded as a neurodegenerative disease, and nearly 70% of the risk factors are believed to be genetic. Other risk factors include head trauma, depression and high blood pressure.
[2] The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. But at a basic level, it's due to brain proteins not functioning properly. This disrupts the working of brain cells (neurons), which triggers a cascade of events. Neurons become damaged, lose their ability to connect to each other, and eventually the neurons die.
[3] There is accumulation of tau protein and amyloid protein (amyloid) in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The medical community believes that these two proteins may be the cause of the disease.
[4] Some studies have shown that people with APOE4 variant genes are at a significantly increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease if they are also infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV1).
[5] Relevant studies have shown that increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
[6] Alzheimer's disease is a common form of dementia that begins with mild memory loss and may eventually lead to the inability to hold conversations and respond to the environment. The disease involves areas of the brain that control thinking, memory and language, severely affecting the ability to carry out daily activities.
[7] Alzheimer's disease is a brain disease that worsens over time and is characterized by changes in the brain that lead to the deposition of specific proteins. The disease causes brain shrinkage and eventual cell death and is the most common cause of dementia. In the United States, approximately 6.5 million people age 65 and older have Alzheimer's disease, and more than 70% of them are age 75 and older. There are approximately 55 million people worldwide with dementia, and an estimated 60% to 70% of them have Alzheimer's disease.
[8] Alzheimer's disease is a form of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior, with symptoms gradually worsening and interfering with daily tasks. Accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases, it mainly occurs in people aged 65 and above. It is not a normal aging phenomenon and the biggest risk factor is increasing age. Although there is no cure, some treatments such as the aducanutril antibody and lecatizumab have been shown to slow cognitive and functional decline in the early stages. The world is working hard to find better treatments to delay the onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease.
[9] Scientists are making progress in understanding Alzheimer's disease, but their causes are not yet fully understood. The importance of risk varies among individuals, possibly through interactions with age-related brain changes, genetics, environment and lifestyle factors.
[10] The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood and may involve age-related changes in the brain, changes or differences in genes, as well as health, environmental, and lifestyle factors. These factors include brain shrinkage, inflammation, blood vessel damage, energy collapse, etc. Gene-related early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be related to familial gene transmission. Health, environmental and lifestyle factors such as exposure to pollutants, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may also play a role.

Query:
What are the causes of Alzheimer's disease?

Answer:
The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood [1][10], and it may be the result of the interaction of multiple factors [9]. Various influencing factors, including brain age[8][10], genetic factors[1][10], genetic variation[10], increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)[5], head trauma[1], depression [1], hypertension [1], diabetes and obesity [10], pollutant exposure [10], and other factors involving health, environment, and lifestyle [10] may increase the risk of disease. Studies have shown that people with APOE4 mutated genes have a significantly increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease if they are also infected with the herpes virus (HSV1) [4]. Overall, there are many factors that contribute to Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

[1] Meatballs are a video game genre characterized by game levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permadeath for the player character.
[2] In the process of repeatedly playing the Meat Pigeon game, players continue to deepen their understanding of the game mechanics. The feedback of this knowledge is one of the fascinating aspects of this game.
[3] The proprietary term "Roguelike" for meat pigeon games comes from the 1980 game "Rogue", which is a dungeon exploration role-playing game with the characteristics of classic meat pigeon games.
[4] The Meat Pigeon game is highly random. The levels, items and even stories of each game are random, providing a unique experience for every game.
[5] The high degree of randomness and complex mechanisms determine that meat pigeon games are often difficult and require players to learn through trial and error.
[6] The term "Roguelike" comes from the 1980 classic game "Rogue". This turn-based dungeon crawler uses ASCII graphics and procedural generation to create a unique and unpredictable gaming experience, becoming the blueprint for later "Roguelike" games.
[7] Roguelike games are a type of game modeled after the famous game "Rogue" in the 1980s. They focus on failure and restarting, and make each gameplay unique through randomized design. Usually including features such as limited health, hard punishment, gradually strengthening characters, and randomly generated maps, players need to rely on tactics and skills to gradually achieve success.
[8] Roguelike games are derived from "Rogue" and usually include permanent death, procedural generation and turn-based systems. In recent years, these features have become more flexible in indie games, with some being classified as "roguelike", "roguelite" or "roguelike-like", retaining the "Rogue" DNA and introducing innovations such as upgrade progression.
[9] Ultimately, whether a game is a roguelike should be defined by player learning and exploration. Although there are specific definitions such as the Berlin Interpretation, the diversity of games such as Diablo, The Binding of Isaac, and Spelunky has broadened the definition of "roguelike" or "containing roguelike elements."

[1] Succulents generally prefer loose, breathable soil. It is recommended to use special succulent soil, or use materials such as vermiculite, perlite or panchen soil to improve drainage.
[2] Succulents should not be watered too much, and containers should also be drained. Excessive water may cause the roots of succulents to rot.
[3] Contrary to common belief, succulents, including cacti, benefit from regular watering during the growing season. The key is to wait for the soil to dry before watering, allowing the roots to breathe. Watering frequency varies with the season, pot size and soil conditions and can range from a few days to two or three weeks. Succulents can often survive months without watering.
[4] The suitable temperature for most succulents to grow is between 15 and 28 degrees Celsius. Frostbite, even withering and death are likely to occur when the temperature is below 5 degrees Celsius.
[5] Beginner succulent growers should not overexpose their plants to sunlight. Thousands of succulent species have different light preferences, with most preferring at least two to three hours of sunlight per day or filtered sunlight. When growing indoors, they should be placed next to a window or in a greenhouse with plenty of sunlight. If there are no sunny windows, grow lights can be used for the winter. When the plants enjoy outdoor conditions again, gradually move them outdoors to avoid sunburn.
[6] Succulents generally do not require additional fertilization. If fertilization is necessary, low-concentration, balanced fertilizer can be used during the growth period.
[7] Succulents should be checked regularly for pests and diseases and intervened in a timely manner.
[8] Do not backfill when planting succulents. When planting succulents in your garden, dig a hole the size of the root ball, place the succulent in it, and move away from the plant. Never backfill or bury soil around the roots, leaving gaps will help the soil backfill slowly, in sync with plant growth. This encourages the growth of new roots close to the soil surface, allowing them to breathe.

Query:
What precautions should be taken when growing succulents?

Answer:
When planting succulents, you need to pay attention to soil selection[1], avoid excessive watering and ensure smooth drainage of the container[2][3]. The suitable growth temperature is 15~28 degrees Celsius to prevent frostbite [4]. Fully understand the sunlight needs of different succulents and avoid overexposure [5]. It is not advisable to over-fertilize and use low-concentration balanced fertilizers [6]. Regularly check for pests and diseases and carry out timely intervention [7]. When planting succulents, do not backfill the soil and leave gaps to promote new root growth [8].
