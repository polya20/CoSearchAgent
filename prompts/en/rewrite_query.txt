Your task is to leverage the conversation context to rewrite the current query into a completely independent explicit query.
It is worth noting that if the user's current query is a reply to a clarifying question raised by CollabSearchBot (yourself) in the conversation above, please rewrite it based on the query answered by the clarified question.
